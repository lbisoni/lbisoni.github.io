         <h3 class="post-title">The truths about climate change...</h3>
         <div class="post-content">
<p><i>“We did not weave the web of life, we are merely strands in it. Whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves.” </i> Chief Seattle, 1854.</p>
<p>This website aims to report on the individuals around the world who are working hard to seek the truth about climate change. We humans should continue to give climate change, whether is warming or cooling, the attention it demands. We should inform ourselves based on scientific facts regardless of commercial or political interests.</p>
<p>The consequences of climate change could be catastrophic. I want these little stints of truth, split between the ‘Believers’ and ‘Sceptics’ pages, to inspire hope and spread knowledge. Trying to understand this issue is trying to make the world a better place.</p>
